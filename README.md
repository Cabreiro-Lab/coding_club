# Coding Club

This repository stores the code, data, and materials for the coding club sessions held at the Cabreiro lab. The goal of these sessions is to introduce lab members to data analysis and visualization techniques using R and Python.

The repository is organized into modules, which covered more than one session each, corresponding to a specific topic or session.

## Modules

### Module 01: Bacterial Growth Assay Analysis

This module covers the basics of data analysis in R. We will learn how to:
- Load and clean data.
- Manipulate data frames using `dplyr`.
- Create simple plots using `ggplot2`.

The dataset for this module consists of *E. coli* growth data under different metformin concentrations.

### Module 02: Proteomics Data Analysis

This module delves into more advanced topics, focusing on the analysis of proteomics data. Key topics include:
- Statistical analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins.
- Generating various visualizations, such as volcano plots, PCA plots, and heatmaps.
- Performing functional enrichment analysis using the STRING database.

This module uses both R for data analysis and visualization, and a Python script to interact with the STRING API.

Please refer to the `README.md` file within each module's directory for more detailed information.
